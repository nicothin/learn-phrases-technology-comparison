      <p>This is a tool for learning phrases in a foreign language using the spaced repetition method.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Add words or phrases you are learning.</li>
        <li>Cycle through the added cards, marking correct and incorrect answers.</li>
        <li>After 10 correct marks, the word/phrase is marked as learned and is not shown in the list of learned phrases by default.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is a serverless project. By default, all added words/phrases are saved in the browser storage.<br />But in the settings you can specify data for accessing <a href="https://gist.github.com/" rel="noreferrer">gist</a> and then the data will be periodically saved to it.</p>
